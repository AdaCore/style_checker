    # Matlab makes an assumption about the first comment in a file
    # which makes it tricky to put the copyright notice at the start
    # of the file. The workaround is to put it right after the comment
    # documenting the first entity, which can been quite deep in
    # the file. So scan more lines for a copyright header.
