# The general principle for this config file is the following:
#
#     Our configuration file is composed of one entry per module,
#     with the key being the module name. We also have one special
#     entry where we store the default configuration used for all
#     module. The default configuration is stored under the special
#     module named '*'.
#
#     When looking for a specific configuration, we first
#     look at the entry in the module's section. If not found,
#     then we take the default configuration instead.
#
#     Next, we look in the module's section for an entry whose name
#     is the name of the configuration with a '+' at the front.
#     Eg, if we are looking for the "copyright" configuration
#     for that module, search also for "+copyright". Unlike
#     the entry with the option name, this entry does not
#     override the default option, it adds to it.

# Default configuration, applying to all modules by default.

        # this string followed by a '<copyright holder>' placeholder.

        # A regular expression which matches a correctly formed copyright
        # line.
        #
        # In addition to validating a copyright line as being correctly
        # formed, the regular expressions needs to define two groups
        # that need to be accessible by name. These groups are:
        #
        #   - 'year': A group that matches the copyright end year.
        #         For instance, if the copyright year range was 2014-2016,
        #         then the 'year' group would match '2016'.
        #   - 'holder': The string containing the copyright holder.
        #         For instance, if the copyright line looked like this...
        #
        #             Copyright (C) 2014-2016, Free Software Foundation
        #
        #         ... then the 'holder' group would be matching the string
        #         'Free Software Foundation'
        #
        #         Note that, should the copyright header be "boxed"
        #         (with comment markers both at the start and the end
        #         of the line), this regular expression does not need
        #         to worry about excluding the closing edge of the box.
