# The general principle for this config file is the following:
#
#     Our configuration file is composed of one entry per module,
#     with the key being the module name. We also have one special
#     entry where we store the default configuration used for all
#     module. The default configuration is stored under the special
#     module named '*'.
#
#     When looking for a specific configuration, we first
#     look at the entry in the module's section. If not found,
#     then we take the default configuration instead.
#
#     Next, we look in the module's section for an entry whose name
#     is the name of the configuration with a '+' at the front.
#     Eg, if we are looking for the "copyright" configuration
#     for that module, search also for "+copyright". Unlike
#     the entry with the option name, this entry does not
#     override the default option, it adds to it.

# Default configuration, applying to all modules by default.
